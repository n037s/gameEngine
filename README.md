Project on Visual Studio 2022.

For now we can display a window, and manage to add some objects.
Also the camera is managed and can be controlled by keyboard inputs.



Starting code is in Viewer/Viewer/main.cpp



TO BE DONE :

* Add object text.
* Add object button that can be interracted by mouse.
* I would like to be able to scan Assets folder to detect all images that can be used.
* Next step will be to dissociate Viewer from the main script. I want to have several project separated.
* The first new executable project will be the world editor : displaying world, can add items from assets.
